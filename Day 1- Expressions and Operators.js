//Expression
//A fragment of code that produces a value is an Expression

let a = 46
let b = 9
console.log(a/b)
//gives exact floating point output
console.log(a ** b)
a = 3
a += 5
console.log(a)
// ** is for exponentials
a=3
console.log(a *= a)
b = "6"
console.log(a == b, a != b, a === b, a !== b)
//=== and !== checks type of the variable too
